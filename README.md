## Customer Segmentation Using RFM

--- 

This project applies the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers from an online retail dataset. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, RFM scoring, and rule-based customer segmentation. The analysis is supported by visualizations such as bar charts and heatmaps, and concludes with actionable marketing insights for each customer segment.
